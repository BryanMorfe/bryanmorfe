			"description": "PTDB is a python module that I wrote for fun. It is a parser for plain text. It is a very effective and fast solution for non sensitive local data. It reads from a ptdb-formatted text file and parses all the information into a program that imports it. It was written completely in Python 2.7 but it's backwards compatible with Python 3. PTDB is in active Development."
